# Models
We trained three separate models to predict TFs of different combination, the models are partially showed in these three folders, but the best_save model is not uploaded due to the size limitation, so I provided a google drive link for users to download. After you download the pre-trained model, put it into corresponding model folder, then you can use it to predict TF binding on single cells.

google drive [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PD9GDQEsB-KZnLxPW_bbtBy7KILNdUAn?usp=sharing) and the saved best model is under model folder.

Please feel free to contact us.
