# Data
The Data folder consists of most of the training bulk data and all the the single cell data.
As described in the main text, in the training phase, we trained three models based on different TFs combination, which is generally from three cell lines: GM12878, K562 and H1ESC. 
In the prediction phase, we utilized over 2000 cells retrieved from public datasets, which is shown in the main readme.md and in the paper.
